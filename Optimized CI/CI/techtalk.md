**6. How did you handle resistance or challenges when teaching new DevOps practices?**
**Answer:**

* Used **practical demonstrations and real-world scenarios** to show the benefits of automation.
* Encouraged **questions and discussions**, addressing doubts without overwhelming them with theory.
* Provided **step-by-step guides and documentation** to support learning.

---

**7. How did you measure the effectiveness of your mentoring efforts?**
**Answer:**

* Tracked **reduction in deployment errors** and incidents handled independently by junior engineers.
* Gathered **feedback through surveys and one-on-one sessions** to identify improvement areas.
* Observed **faster adoption of CI/CD pipelines and Kubernetes practices** in project workflows.
