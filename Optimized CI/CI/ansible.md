### **Sample Answers**

**1. Can you explain how you automated server configuration and application deployments using Ansible?**
**Answer:**
I used **Ansible playbooks and roles** to automate server setup, configuration, and application deployments across multiple environments. This included installing packages, configuring services, managing users, and deploying microservices. By automating these tasks, we ensured **consistent, repeatable, and error-free deployments**.

---

**2. What types of servers and applications did you manage with Ansible?**
**Answer:**
I managed **Linux-based EC2 servers** on AWS and deployed **Java microservices, Nginx, and database configurations**. We also used Ansible to configure **load balancers, firewall rules, and scheduled jobs** across environments.

---

**3. How did Ansible help reduce manual intervention and errors?**
**Answer:**

* Tasks that were previously manual, like package installation or environment setup, were fully automated.
* Playbooks enforced **consistent configurations** across all servers.
* Reduced human errors by using **idempotent tasks**, which ensured the same result even if run multiple times.

---

**4. How did you structure your Ansible playbooks and roles for maintainability?**
**Answer:**

* Created **roles for each service or component** (e.g., `java-app`, `nginx`, `database`).
* Used **group_vars and host_vars** to manage environment-specific configurations.
* Organized playbooks by **environment and functionality**, enabling reusability and easier maintenance.

---

**5. How did you handle secrets or sensitive data in Ansible deployments?**
**Answer:**

* Used **Ansible Vault** to encrypt sensitive information like passwords and API keys.
* Stored vault passwords securely and referenced them during automated runs.
* Ensured no plain-text secrets were committed to Git repositories.

---

**6. How did you test and validate your Ansible playbooks before production deployment?**
**Answer:**

* Used **staging environments** to validate playbooks.
* Employed **dry-run mode (`--check`)** to see what changes would occur without applying them.
* Reviewed task outputs and verified service availability after deployment.

---

**7. Can you give an example of a complex automation task you accomplished with Ansible?**
**Answer:**
I automated the **full deployment of a multi-tier Java microservices application**, including:

* Installing and configuring Java and application dependencies
* Setting up system users and permissions
* Deploying the application WAR/JAR files
* Configuring Nginx as a reverse proxy
* Restarting services and validating endpoints

This reduced deployment time from **2–3 hours manually to 15–20 minutes** and eliminated configuration inconsistencies.

If you want, I can **also combine this Ansible Q&A with your Kubernetes, GitOps, Terraform, and CI/CD Q&A** into a **full DevOps interview prep guide** covering all your resume points.

Do you want me to do that?
