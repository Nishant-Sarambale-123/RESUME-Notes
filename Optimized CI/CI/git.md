### **Sample Answers**

**1. Can you explain the Git best practices you established in your team?**
**Answer:**
I established **standardized Git workflows** to ensure consistent collaboration. This included naming conventions for branches, pull request (PR) reviews, commit message guidelines, and integrating CI/CD pipelines to automate builds and tests on code changes.

---

**2. How did you define and implement branching strategies?**
**Answer:**

* Implemented **Git Flow** with separate branches for **main, develop, feature, release, and hotfix**.
* Feature branches were used for development, merged into **develop** after code review and testing.
* Release branches allowed **stable deployment to production** without disrupting ongoing development.

---

**3. How did you set up webhooks to improve CI/CD integration?**
**Answer:**

* Configured **GitHub webhooks** to trigger CI/CD pipelines in Jenkins or GitHub Actions whenever code was pushed or a PR was created.
* This enabled **automated builds, tests, and deployments**, reducing manual intervention and speeding up feedback cycles.

---

**4. How did these Git practices improve code collaboration and traceability?**
**Answer:**

* Teams could **work simultaneously on features** without conflicts.
* Every commit and PR was **traceable to a specific task or issue**.
* Automated CI/CD feedback ensured **code quality and reduced integration issues**.

---

**5. Can you give an example of a situation where proper Git practices prevented issues?**
**Answer:**

* A critical bug was accidentally introduced in a feature branch. Because of **branching and PR review policies**, it was caught in **code review and automated tests** before merging into the main branch, preventing production issues.

---

**6. How did you handle code reviews and merge processes in Git?**
**Answer:**

* Implemented **mandatory pull request reviews** before merging.
* Used **branch protection rules** to prevent direct pushes to main or develop branches.
* Enforced automated **CI checks** to pass before allowing merges.

---

**7. How did you onboard new team members to follow these Git best practices?**
**Answer:**

* Created **documentation and cheat sheets** for branching, commits, PRs, and workflows.
* Conducted **hands-on sessions** to demonstrate best practices.
* Paired new engineers with senior team members for initial tasks to reinforce learning.
