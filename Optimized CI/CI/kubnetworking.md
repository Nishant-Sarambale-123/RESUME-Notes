### **Possible Interview Questions**

1. Can you explain the Kubernetes networking setup you configured using Ingress and ALB?
2. How did you integrate Route53 with ALB for custom domain deployments?
3. What challenges did you face while configuring Ingress and custom domains, and how did you solve them?
4. How did you ensure high availability and security for applications exposed via Ingress and ALB?
5. Which Ingress controller did you use, and why?
6. How did you handle SSL/TLS certificates for your custom domains?
7. How do you troubleshoot issues when a service is not accessible through the custom domain?

### **Sample Answers**

**1. Can you explain the Kubernetes networking setup you configured using Ingress and ALB?**
**Answer:**
I configured **AWS ALB (Application Load Balancer)** as the external entry point for Kubernetes services. The ALB routes traffic to the **Kubernetes Ingress controller**, which then forwards requests to the appropriate services based on path or host rules. This setup allowed us to expose multiple services on **custom domains** efficiently while keeping the cluster secure and scalable.

---

**2. How did you integrate Route53 with ALB for custom domain deployments?**
**Answer:**
I created **hosted zones in Route53** for our custom domains and set up **A/alias records** pointing to the ALB DNS name. This ensured that requests to our domain were routed through ALB to the Kubernetes cluster. We also used **path-based routing** in the Ingress rules to direct traffic to multiple microservices behind the same ALB.

---

**3. What challenges did you face and how did you solve them?**
**Answer:**

* **DNS propagation delays:** We used **short TTLs** during testing to speed up validation.
* **SSL/TLS certificate management:** We automated certificate provisioning with **AWS ACM** and integrated it with ALB for HTTPS.
* **Path conflicts in Ingress rules:** We standardized URL paths and enforced naming conventions.

---

**4. How did you ensure high availability and security?**
**Answer:**

* Configured ALB **target groups across multiple AZs** for high availability.
* Enforced **HTTPS using TLS certificates** from AWS ACM.
* Implemented **network policies and security groups** to restrict access only to necessary ports.
* Enabled **health checks** on the ALB to automatically route traffic only to healthy pods.

---

**5. Which Ingress controller did you use and why?**
**Answer:**
We used the **AWS ALB Ingress Controller** because it integrates natively with AWS services, supports dynamic provisioning of ALB resources, path-based routing, SSL termination, and works seamlessly with EKS clusters.

---

**6. How do you troubleshoot issues when a service is not accessible via custom domain?**
**Answer:**

* Check **Route53 records** to confirm domain points to the correct ALB.
* Validate **ALB listener rules** and target group health.
* Inspect **Ingress resource logs** for misconfigured paths or host rules.
* Verify **security group and network ACL** rules.
* Use **`kubectl describe ingress`** and **`kubectl logs`** to identify pod-level issues.

If you want, I can also **combine this with your Kubernetes adoption and CI/CD points** to make a **complete set of 20–25 interview Q&A** for DevOps, so you can prepare for any question confidently.

Do you want me to do that?
