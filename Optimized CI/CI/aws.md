### **Sample Answers**

**1. Can you describe your experience managing AWS infrastructure for high availability?**
**Answer:**
I managed **AWS infrastructure components** including EC2, VPC, S3, IAM, Route53, Load Balancers, and CloudWatch to ensure **high availability and fault tolerance**. This included designing multi-AZ deployments, configuring auto-scaling, and setting up monitoring and alerting to maintain service uptime.

---

**2. How did you design and manage VPCs and subnets?**
**Answer:**

* Created **VPCs with public and private subnets** across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) for redundancy.
* Configured **route tables, NAT gateways, and internet gateways** for proper traffic flow.
* Applied **security groups and network ACLs** to control access and ensure security.

---

**3. How did you ensure EC2 instances were highly available and fault-tolerant?**
**Answer:**

* Launched EC2 instances in **multiple AZs**.
* Configured **Auto Scaling Groups (ASG)** to handle traffic spikes and replace unhealthy instances automatically.
* Attached instances to **Elastic Load Balancers (ALB/NLB)** to distribute traffic evenly.

---

**4. How did you configure Load Balancers to handle traffic efficiently?**
**Answer:**

* Used **Application Load Balancers (ALB)** for HTTP/HTTPS traffic and **Network Load Balancers (NLB)** for TCP/UDP traffic.
* Configured **listener rules and target groups** for routing requests to appropriate instances or services.
* Enabled **health checks** to ensure only healthy instances receive traffic.

---

**5. How did you manage IAM roles and permissions securely?**
**Answer:**

* Followed **least privilege principle** by granting only necessary permissions.
* Used **IAM roles for EC2 instances and services** instead of embedding credentials.
* Enabled **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** for all privileged users and implemented role-based access control for teams.

---

**6. How did you use Route53 for DNS management?**
**Answer:**

* Created **hosted zones** for our domains and configured **A/AAAA/alias records** to route traffic to ALB/NLB.
* Implemented **health checks and failover routing policies** to ensure high availability.
* Configured **weighted and latency-based routing** to optimize traffic distribution across regions.

---

**7. How did you monitor AWS resources and set up alerts?**
**Answer:**

* Used **CloudWatch metrics, logs, and dashboards** to monitor EC2, RDS, and application performance.
* Set up **CloudWatch Alarms** to trigger notifications via SNS for critical events like high CPU usage, failed instances, or unhealthy load balancer targets.
* Integrated monitoring with **Grafana and Prometheus** for centralized observability.

---

**8. Can you explain a challenge you faced while managing AWS infrastructure and how you resolved it?**
**Answer:**

* **Challenge:** EC2 instances in a single AZ failed during maintenance, causing downtime.
* **Solution:** Implemented **multi-AZ architecture with Auto Scaling and ALB** to distribute workloads. Configured **Route53 health checks and failover** to redirect traffic automatically, ensuring zero downtime during failures.

If you want, I can **also combine this AWS Q&A with all your other DevOps skills** (Kubernetes, GitOps, Terraform, Ansible, CI/CD, GitHub Actions) into a **complete DevOps interview preparation guide** covering technical, scenario-based, and behavioral questions.

Do you want me to do that?
